    "- Addition: `x + y`\n",

    "- Multiplication: `x * y`\n",

    "- Exponentiation: `x ** y`\n",
    "- Modulo (remainder): `x % y`\n",

    "These basic arithmetic operations can be combined to create more complex expressions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(x + y) * (a - b) / z`\n",
    "- `(x ** 2 + y ** 2) ** 0.5` (Pythagorean theorem)\n",
    "- `(x + y) / 2` (average or mean)\n",
